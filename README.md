# labor-market-statistics-import

## TODO
---
Import data in two diffrent ways    
1. Import the whole dataset.
2. Import only if data in source is newer than keept data.    

Start (1) first time run, there after when needed.
Start (2) every night during work week.    

Robustness
----------
- import to new collection <name-import> and rename it to production collection name, after origin is renamed to <name-date>
